## A byte about me
*Well, I'd have used a bit but a byte sound about eight times better :grin:*

I am a fullstack and Android engineer based in Nairobi, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design, combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create beautiful products. I have great passion for building mobile and web applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel perfect user experiences.
